### Hi there 👋
I'm currently an undergraduate studying Computer Science at Rochester Institute of Technology. I enjoy pouring my time into developing web applications I am passionate about. I am the most comfortable developing frontends with React.js, but I also have experience scripting with Node.js and writing REST API's using Express.js and Flask. As a developing software engineer, I am excited to try my hand at new skills and open to learning new technologies!
